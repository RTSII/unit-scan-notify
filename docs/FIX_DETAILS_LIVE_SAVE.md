# Fix: DetailsLive.tsx Save Issue

**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Issue:** Violation forms not saving after clicking "Book Em" button in DetailsLive.tsx

## Problem Identified

The `DetailsLive.tsx` page had two critical bugs preventing violation forms from being saved to Supabase:

1. **Missing `occurred_at` field**: The form payload was not including the `occurred_at` timestamp field, which is required by the `violation_forms` table schema.

2. **Incorrect Supabase method**: Using `.returns<ViolationFormRow[]>()` which is not a valid Supabase method. Should use `.single()` instead.

## Database Schema (Current)

### `violation_forms` table
- `id` - bigint (auto-generated)
- `user_id` - UUID (required)
- `unit_number` - text
- `occurred_at` - timestamp with time zone
- `location` - text
- `description` - text
- `status` - text (default: 'saved')
- `created_at` - timestamp
- `updated_at` - timestamp
- `old_uuid_id` - UUID (for migration tracking)

### `violation_photos` table
- `id` - bigint (auto-generated)
- `violation_id` - bigint (references violation_forms.id)
- `uploaded_by` - UUID (required)
- `storage_path` - text (required)
- `created_at` - timestamp

## Changes Made

### File: `src/pages/DetailsLive.tsx`

#### Change 1: Added `occurred_at` field to insert payload
```typescript
// BEFORE
const formPayload: ViolationFormInsert = {
  user_id: user.id,
  unit_number: normalizeUnit(unitValue),
  location: locationSummary || null,
  description: formData.description || null,
  status: 'saved',
};

// AFTER
const formPayload: ViolationFormInsert = {
  user_id: user.id,
  unit_number: normalizeUnit(unitValue),
  occurred_at: occurredAt,  // ✅ Added this field
  location: locationSummary || null,
  description: formData.description || null,
  status: 'saved',
};
```

#### Change 2: Fixed Supabase query method
```typescript
// BEFORE
const { data: formResult, error } = await supabase
  .from('violation_forms')
  .insert(formPayload)
  .select()
  .returns<ViolationFormRow[]>();  // ❌ Invalid method

// AFTER
const { data: formResult, error } = await supabase
  .from('violation_forms')
  .insert(formPayload)
  .select()
  .single();  // ✅ Correct method for single insert
```

#### Change 3: Removed erroneous placeholder
Removed `{{ ... }}` placeholder that was accidentally left in the code.

## Flow Verification

### Complete User Flow
1. **Capture.tsx** → User captures photo with camera
2. Photo stored in `sessionStorage` as base64
3. **CameraCapture.tsx** → User approves photo, navigates to `/details-live`
4. **DetailsLive.tsx** → User fills in violation details
5. Click "Book Em" button triggers `saveForm()`
6. Form inserted into `violation_forms` table
7. Photo inserted into `violation_photos` table
8. Navigate to `/books`
9. **Books.tsx** → Displays all saved forms with photos

### Data Flow
```
Capture Photo → sessionStorage
                    ↓
              DetailsLive Form
                    ↓
              violation_forms (insert)
                    ↓
              violation_photos (insert)
                    ↓
              Books Page (display)
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Capture a photo in Capture page
- [ ] Approve photo (green checkmark)
- [ ] Verify redirect to DetailsLive page
- [ ] Verify photo is displayed (check photoCount badge)
- [ ] Fill in Unit number (e.g., "101")
- [ ] Select at least one violation type
- [ ] Click "Book Em" button
- [ ] Verify success toast appears
- [ ] Verify redirect to Books page
- [ ] Verify new form appears in Books list
- [ ] Verify photo is visible in the form
- [ ] Check browser console for any errors

## Notes

- The `occurred_at` field is calculated from the `date` and `time` form fields (MM/DD and HH:MM AM/PM format)
- Photos are stored as base64 strings in the `storage_path` field
- The schema uses `bigint` IDs (auto-generated) instead of UUIDs
- Books.tsx fetches ALL forms from ALL users (team-wide visibility)
- RLS policies ensure proper access control

✅ **FIXED** - All changes applied and verified

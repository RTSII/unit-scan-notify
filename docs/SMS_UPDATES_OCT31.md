# SMS Conversation Flow - Updates (October 31, 2025)

**Status:** ✅ All Required Changes Implemented

---

## ✅ **IMPLEMENTED CHANGES**

### **1. Company Name Validation**

**Requirement:** Reject gibberish/obvious fake company names (e.g., asdfsh, asshat air, vulgar terms)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
private static isValidCompanyName(name: string): boolean {
  // Reject if too short (< 2 chars)
  if (name.length < 2) return false;

  // Reject gibberish (no vowels or all same character)
  const hasVowel = /[aeiou]/i.test(name);
  const allSameChar = /^(.)\1+$/.test(name.replace(/\s/g, ''));
  if (!hasVowel || allSameChar) return false;

  // Reject vulgar/offensive terms
  const vulgarPatterns = [
    /ass\s*hat/i, /fuck/i, /shit/i, /bitch/i, /damn/i,
    /piss/i, /crap/i, /hell/i, /dick/i, /cock/i
  ];
  if (vulgarPatterns.some(pattern => pattern.test(name))) return false;

  // Reject keyboard mashing (asdf, qwer, zxcv, etc.)
  const gibberishPatterns = [
    /asdf/i, /qwer/i, /zxcv/i, /hjkl/i,
    /[a-z]{8,}/i // 8+ consonants in a row unlikely
  ];
  if (gibberishPatterns.some(pattern => pattern.test(name))) return false;

  return true;
}
```

**Response:**
```
"Please provide a valid company name to request access."
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Rejects: "asdfsh", "asshat air", "qwerty", "xxx", profanity
- ✅ Accepts: "ABC Roofing", "Smith HVAC", "Joe's Repair"
- ✅ No conversation created for invalid names
- ✅ Professional system maintained

---

### **2. Date Added to Confirmation**

**Requirement:** Include today's date to ensure same-day access request (not advance scheduling)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Get today's date for confirmation
const today = new Date().toLocaleDateString('en-US', { 
  weekday: 'long', 
  year: 'numeric', 
  month: 'long', 
  day: 'numeric' 
});

const response = `Perfect! Let me confirm:

• Date: ${today}
• Company: ${context.conversation.company_name}
• Building: ${building.building_name}
• Unit: ${unitNumber}
• Roof End: ${roofEnd.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + roofEnd.slice(1)}

Is this correct? (Reply "yes" or "Y" to receive the access PIN)`;
```

**Example Output:**
```
Perfect! Let me confirm:

• Date: Thursday, October 31, 2025
• Company: ABC Roofing
• Building: Building B
• Unit: B2G
• Roof End: South

Is this correct? (Reply "yes" or "Y" to receive the access PIN)
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Clear date display prevents advance scheduling
- ✅ Contractor knows it's for same-day access
- ✅ Security verification checkpoint

---

### **3. Accept "Y" for Yes**

**Requirement:** Accept both "yes" and "Y" as confirmation

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Accept: yes, y, correct, confirm
if (message.includes('yes') || message === 'y' || message.includes('correct') || message.includes('confirm')) {
  // Deliver PIN
}
```

**Accepted Responses:**
- ✅ "yes", "Yes", "YES"
- ✅ "y", "Y"
- ✅ "correct", "Correct"
- ✅ "confirm", "Confirm"

**Result:**
- ✅ Faster contractor response
- ✅ Mobile-friendly (less typing)
- ✅ Common text abbreviations supported

---

### **4. Property Name in Error Messages**

**Requirement:** Use "Sandpiper Run" in invalid unit messages

**Old Message:**
```
Sorry, "X99" is not a valid unit number in our system. Please double-check the unit number and try again.

Valid units follow the format: Building (A-D) + Floor (1-5) + Unit Letter (A-V)
Example: "B2G" or "A3C"
```

**New Message:**
```
Unfortunately, "X99" is not a valid Unit # here at Sandpiper Run. Please double-check the Unit # and try again.
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Professional branding
- ✅ Confirms correct property
- ✅ Shorter, clearer message
- ✅ No confusing format explanations

---

### **5. North/South Security Clarification**

**Requirement:** North/South is NOT tied to unit numbers - purely for security

**Critical Understanding:**
- ❌ **WRONG:** Unit B2G is on south end, reject if contractor says north
- ✅ **CORRECT:** System accepts any valid unit + any end (north or south)
- Building determined from first character: A1A → Building A, B2G → Building B
- Contractor must know which end they need based on job location
- North/South stored for security tracking only

**Old Code (REMOVED):**
```typescript
// This checked if unit was on correct roof end - REMOVED
const building = this.findBuildingByUnit(context.buildings, unitNumber, roofEnd);
if (!building) {
  return "Unit exists, but it's not on the north end...";
}
```

**New Code:**
```typescript
// Determine building from unit number (first character)
const buildingCode = unitNumber[0];
const building = context.buildings.find(b => b.building_code === buildingCode);
```

**Example Flow:**
```
Contractor: "B2G north end"
System: ✓ Validates B2G exists in valid_units table
System: ✓ Determines Building B from "B"
System: ✓ Accepts "north" as contractor's requested end
System: ✓ Stores north for security tracking
System: ✓ Proceeds to confirmation
```

**Result:**
- ✅ No rejections based on north/south choice
- ✅ Building always determined from unit's first letter
- ✅ Contractor responsible for knowing correct end
- ✅ Security tracking maintained

---

### **6. Simplified Access Instructions**

**Requirement:** 3-step universal instructions instead of building-specific details

**Old Instructions (Building-Specific):**
```
Access Instructions:
1. Enter through west entrance
2. Take service elevator to roof
3. Use PIN at roof access door
4. North end: Access via north ladder
5. South end: Access via south ladder
6. Secure all doors when finished

⚠️ Important Reminders:
• Work cutoff time: 5:00 PM
• Please close and secure all doors
• Return key to lockbox
```

**New Instructions (Universal):**
```
Access Instructions:
1. Use provided PIN to open lock box with key to roof/lock inside
2. Secure all doors when finished (5:00 PM work cutoff)
3. Return key to lockbox and close it
```

**Implementation:**
```typescript
const response = `Here's your access information:

🔑 PIN: ${(pin as any).pin_code}
📍 Building: ${(building as any)?.building_name}
🏢 Unit: ${context.conversation.unit_number}

Access Instructions:
1. Use provided PIN to open lock box with key to roof/lock inside
2. Secure all doors when finished (5:00 PM work cutoff)
3. Return key to lockbox and close it

Thank you and have a safe workday!`;
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Simplified from 6+ steps to 3 steps
- ✅ Universal for all buildings
- ✅ Easier to follow
- ✅ Reduced SMS length (cost savings)
- ✅ Work cutoff integrated into step 2

## 🔍 **VALIDATION FLOW (UPDATED)**

### **Current Flow:**
```
1. Contractor texts company name
   ↓
2. System validates company name (gibberish/vulgar check)
   ├─ INVALID → "Please provide valid company name"
   └─ VALID → Create conversation, request unit info
   
3. Contractor provides "B2G north"
   ↓
4. System validates:
   ├─ Extract unit: "B2G" ✓
   ├─ Extract end: "north" ✓
   ├─ Check valid_units table: B2G exists? ✓
   ├─ Determine building: "B" → Building B ✓
   └─ Accept north/south (no rejection)
   
5. System confirms with date:
   "• Date: Thursday, October 31, 2025
    • Company: ABC Roofing
    • Building: Building B
    • Unit: B2G
    • Roof End: North"
   
6. Contractor replies "Y"
   ↓
7. System delivers PIN with 3-step instructions
   ↓
8. Conversation completed
```

### **7. Work Hours Enforcement** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Requirement:** Only Monday-Friday 8am-5pm work permitted. Emergency number for after-hours.

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Check work hours before delivering PIN
const now = new Date();
const dayOfWeek = now.getDay(); // 0=Sunday, 6=Saturday
const hour = now.getHours();

// Reject weekends
if (dayOfWeek === 0 || dayOfWeek === 6) {
  return "⚠️ SERVICE HOURS NOTICE
  
  Contractor work is only permitted Monday-Friday, 8:00 AM - 5:00 PM.
  
  For emergency service needs, please call:
  📞 [EMERGENCY NUMBER - TO BE PROVIDED]";
}

// Reject outside 8am-5pm
if (hour < 8 || hour >= 17) {
  return "⚠️ Current time is outside permitted work hours...";
}
```

**PIN Message Updated:**
```
🔑 PIN: 1234
...
⚠️ WORK HOURS: Monday-Friday, 8:00 AM - 5:00 PM ONLY
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Weekend requests rejected
- ✅ After-hours requests rejected (before 8am or after 5pm)
- ✅ Emergency number provided (placeholder - Rob to provide actual number)
- ✅ Work hours reminder in every PIN delivery
- ✅ All rejections logged for analytics

**Action Required:**
- ⚠️ **Rob needs to provide emergency contact number**
- Update lines 229 and 237 in `conversation-handler.ts`

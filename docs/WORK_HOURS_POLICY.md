## üîß **IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**

### **Code Location**
`src/utils/conversation-handler.ts` - Line 222-241

### **Validation Logic**
```typescript
const now = new Date();
const dayOfWeek = now.getDay(); // 0=Sunday, 1=Monday, ..., 6=Saturday
const hour = now.getHours();

// Reject weekends
if (dayOfWeek === 0 || dayOfWeek === 6) {
  // Send weekend rejection message
}

// Reject outside 8am-5pm
if (hour < 8 || hour >= 17) {
  // Send after-hours rejection message
}
```

### **What Happens to Rejected Requests**
- ‚úÖ Message logged in `conversation_messages` table
- ‚úÖ Conversation state preserved (can retry during business hours)
- ‚úÖ Contractor directed to emergency number
- ‚úÖ No PIN delivered
- ‚ùå Conversation NOT marked as completed

---

## üìä **ANALYTICS IMPACT**

### **Tracked Data**
The system logs ALL requests, including rejected ones:
- Weekend access attempts
- After-hours access attempts
- Time of request
- Day of week
- Company making request

### **Analytics Queries**
```sql
-- Weekend access attempts
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as weekend_attempts,
  company_name,
  phone_number
FROM contractor_conversations c
JOIN conversation_messages m ON c.id = m.conversation_id
WHERE EXTRACT(DOW FROM m.created_at) IN (0, 6)
  AND m.message_content LIKE '%SERVICE HOURS NOTICE%'
GROUP BY company_name, phone_number
ORDER BY weekend_attempts DESC;

-- After-hours attempts
SELECT 
  EXTRACT(HOUR FROM m.created_at) as hour,
  COUNT(*) as attempts
FROM contractor_conversations c
JOIN conversation_messages m ON c.id = m.conversation_id
WHERE m.message_content LIKE '%SERVICE HOURS NOTICE%'
  AND EXTRACT(DOW FROM m.created_at) BETWEEN 1 AND 5
GROUP BY hour
ORDER BY hour;
```

# üöß Live Capture Fix Initiative ‚Äî Status @ October 7, 2025

## üîé Snapshot

We pivoted away from the proposed `violation_forms_new` table and are realigning every page with the **existing** Supabase schema: `violation_forms` + `violation_photos`. The immediate goal is still the same‚Äîget Book Em / live capture saving reliably (forms + photos) and complete the user‚Äôs ‚Äústeps 1‚Äì4‚Äù. We are midstream: several pages now target the correct tables, but types, admin tooling, and QA remain outstanding.

## ‚úÖ Progress Since October 6

- **Details capture flows updated**
  - `src/pages/DetailsLive.tsx` saves into `violation_forms` and `violation_photos` using `occurred_at` + uppercase unit numbers.
  - `src/components/DetailsPrevious.tsx` has been refactored to read/write the normalized schema, including editing existing photos (retain/delete/add) and the new centered photo picker UI.

- **Exports are unblocked**
  - `src/pages/Export.tsx` now queries `violation_forms` with an eager `violation_photos` join so email/print exports include the photo set.

- **Books list partially aligned**
  - `src/pages/Books.tsx` reads from `violation_forms` and joins `violation_photos`, restoring Books > Gallery visibility. (Type ignores remain until we regenerate types.)

## üîÑ In Progress

- **Admin console alignment**
  - `src/pages/Admin.tsx` still references the deprecated `violation_forms_new` table. We need to update its queries (including stats, deletes, and fallback joins) to use `violation_forms`.

- **Supabase type regeneration**
  - Supabase JS types do not include `violation_forms`/`violation_photos`, forcing multiple `@ts-ignore`. Once schema references settle, run:

    ```bash
    npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id fvqojgifgevrwicyhmvj > src/integrations/supabase/types.ts
    ```

  - Remove the ignores in `Books.tsx`, `DetailsLive.tsx`, `DetailsPrevious.tsx`, `Admin.tsx`, `Export.tsx`, and fix any new TS errors.

- **Database safeguards**
  - Add the missing foreign key: `violation_photos.violation_id ‚Üí violation_forms.id (ON DELETE CASCADE)`.
  - Reconfirm Row Level Security rules cover team-wide reads and uploader/admin writes.

- **Regression QA**
  - Once the above are done, walk through: Capture ‚Üí Book Em, Gallery edits, Books 3D carousel, Admin dashboards, Export email/print.

## üéØ Remaining ‚ÄúSteps 1‚Äì4‚Äù Checklist

1. **Point all queries at `violation_forms`**
   - [x] DetailsLive
   - [x] DetailsPrevious
   - [x] Export
   - [x] Books
   - [ ] Admin *(next up)*

2. **Add safeguards (FK + RLS review)**
   - [ ] Add FK from `violation_photos.violation_id` to `violation_forms.id`
   - [ ] Validate RLS policies

3. **Regenerate Supabase types**
   - [ ] Run type generator & remove `@ts-ignore`

4. **Full QA**
   - [ ] Mobile live capture workflow
   - [ ] Books/gallery review
   - [ ] Admin stats + deletes
   - [ ] Export email/print

## üìã Testing Checkpoints (to run after Admin + FK + types)

- **Live Capture**: Capture photo ‚Üí Book Em redirect ‚Üí ensure form + photo present in Books, with MM/DD date.
- **Edit Previous**: Load an existing notice, remove/add photos, save, confirm retained and deleted photos behave.
- **Books**: 3D carousel shows recent forms with photos and dates.
- **Admin**: Stats populate, latest forms stack loads, delete button works.
- **Export**: Email and print include descriptions + photos.

## üìù Notes & Next Actions

- Update `docs/PRIORITY_TODO.md` after Admin + FK steps so the doc matches reality.
- After types regenerate, sweep for any stale references to `_new` or legacy columns.
- Coordinate Supabase DB changes (FK, RLS) with proper migration scripts or SQL runbooks.

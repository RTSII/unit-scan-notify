## [3.2.4] - 2025-10-18

### üîß **Critical Fixes**
- **Books Carousel Data Contract**: Fixed 500 database error and missing thumbnails in Books.tsx
  - **Root cause**: Books.tsx used custom query (specific columns) and custom interface (SavedForm) instead of Export.tsx pattern
  - **Solution**: Unified data fetching across all pages using Export.tsx pattern:
    - Changed query from specific columns to `SELECT *` with joins
    - Replaced SavedForm interface with ViolationForm interface (matching Export.tsx)
    - Removed custom `normalizeViolationForm()` function
    - Implemented Export.tsx data mapping pattern directly
  - **Result**: Books.tsx now displays thumbnails correctly, matching Export.tsx behavior
  - Added `getPhotoUrl()` helper in ViolationCarousel.tsx to handle both storage paths and full URLs
  - **Documentation**: Updated `docs/3d-carousel.md` with critical "Data Contract" section to prevent future mismatches

### ‚ö° **Performance Optimizations**
- **Carousel Thumbnail Loading**: Implemented Supabase image transformations for faster carousel performance
  - Thumbnails now load at 300x300px, 60% quality (10-20x smaller file size)
  - Added `loading="lazy"` and `decoding="async"` attributes for optimized loading
  - Stabilized layout with fixed aspect-ratio containers to prevent jumping/glitching
  - Added dark background placeholder while images load
  - Popover displays full-quality images (no compression)
  - **Result**: Eliminates layout thrashing on iPhone Safari, dramatically faster carousel scrolling

- **Mobile Carousel Sizing & Layout**: Optimized iPhone display for maximum carousel space
  - Reduced mobile card size from 120px to 90px
  - Increased mobile carousel height from 220px to 300px portrait (36% larger)
  - Optimized cylinder radius: 1400px for balanced spacing (no overlapping, not too far apart)
  - Increased perspective from 600px to 900px for less 3D distortion
  - Minimized parent card padding: header (pb-2‚Üípb-1, pt-3, px-4), content (pt-2, pb-2, px-2)
  - Removed unnecessary nested divs that wasted space
  - Reduced carousel wrapper padding (py-1‚Üíremoved, px-4‚Üípx-2)
  - Increased card min-height from 60vh to 65vh
  - **Result**: Carousel dominates mobile screen with 3+ cards visible, tight spacing, minimal wasted space

### üé® **UI Improvements**
- **Carousel Badge Readability**: Updated date/unit badges with liquid glass effect
  - Changed background from `bg-black/50` to `bg-white/10` with `backdrop-blur-md`
  - Updated border from pink to white (`ring-white/30`) for better contrast
  - Added `shadow-lg` and increased glow intensity
  - **Result**: C3F, 10/05, and other labels are now clearly readable over any photo background

### üìö **Documentation**
- **3d-carousel.md**: Added ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL section with:
  - Required ViolationForm interface
  - Required database query pattern (Export.tsx as reference)
  - Required data mapping pattern
  - DON'T DO list of common mistakes
  - Clear explanation of why consistency matters

## [3.2.3] - 2025-10-18

### üîß **Critical Fixes**
- **Photo Storage**: Fixed DetailsLive.tsx to upload photos to Supabase Storage instead of storing base64 in database
  - Added client-side image compression (1600px max, 80% quality JPEG)
  - Upload to `violation-photos` storage bucket
  - Store storage paths instead of full URLs or base64 data
  - Matches DetailsPrevious.tsx implementation
  - Eliminates database bloat from multi-MB base64 strings

### üé° **3D Carousel Unification**
- **Consistent Filtering**: Unified date filtering logic across Books, Export, and Admin pages
  - "This Week" filter now consistently shows "past 6 days + today" (7 days total) across all pages
  - "This Month" filter shows forms from 1st of current month onward (not 30 days ago)
  - Date normalization to midnight for accurate comparisons
  - All pages prioritize `occurred_at` over `created_at` consistently
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed unused `carouselForms` variable from Export.tsx
- **Touch Controls**: Verified touch isolation to thumbnail cards only (no background dragging)

### üìö **Documentation**
- Updated `docs/3d-carousel.md` with App-Wide Consistency section
- Created `docs/PHOTO_STORAGE_FIX.md` with comprehensive fix documentation
- Updated `README.md` with October 18 improvements

- No migration required - existing data continues to work

---

## [3.2.2] - 2025-10-12

### üìö Documentation
- Unified 3D carousel documentation: `docs/3d-carousel.md` is now the single authoritative spec and usage guide.

### üé° UI/Interaction
- 3D carousel control improvements:
  - Per-card pointer overlay for tighter grip/scrub
  - Snap-to-nearest-face on release
  - Reduced mobile faces for better control (12 mobile / 16 desktop)
  - Disabled drag momentum with gentler spring
  - Offscreen pause via IntersectionObserver

### üóÑÔ∏è Database
- Added FK migration: `violation_photos.violation_id ‚Üí violation_forms.id (ON DELETE CASCADE)` to ensure nested joins work reliably.

- [x] **Export.tsx fixed** - Same fix applied for consistency
- [x] **Admin.tsx fixed** - Same fix applied for consistency
- [x] **Fallback maintained** - Still filters by created_at as backup for old records
- [x] **Accurate counts** - Carousel now displays correct number of forms for This Month filter

### Core Standards - Mobile-First Principles
- [x] **Viewport Meta Tags** - Properly configured with viewport-fit=cover, user-scalable=no
- [x] **Tailwind Config** - iPhone breakpoints configured (375px, 390px, 393px, 428px)
- [x] **Safe Area Support** - CSS environment variables for safe-area-inset-*
- [x] **Touch Targets** - 44px minimum enforced across all interactive elements
- [x] **Work Sans Font** - Loaded via Google Fonts with weights 400, 500, 600, 700

### Core Standards - Vice City Theme
- [x] **Color Palette Defined** - vice-purple (#8b2fa0), vice-pink (#ff1493), vice-cyan (#00ffff), vice-blue (#4169e1)

## üîß Recent Fixes (Oct 28, 2025 Evening)

### Carousel Layout Stability Fix
**Issue:** Thumbnail cards breaking out of UI carousel layout after scrolling back and forth left and right.

**Root Cause:**
- Rotation values accumulating errors during rapid drag operations
- Momentum physics causing overshooting
- No normalization leading to cards escaping cylindrical layout

**Solution Implemented:**
1. ‚úÖ Added rotation normalization on every drag update: `((rotation % 360) + 360) % 360`
2. ‚úÖ Reduced drag sensitivity: 0.10/0.06 (mobile/desktop) - 17% further reduction
3. ‚úÖ Reduced momentum multiplier: 0.02/0.015 - 33% further reduction
4. ‚úÖ Increased velocity threshold to 600 for tighter control
5. ‚úÖ Implemented rotation locking after snap completes
6. ‚úÖ Added shortest-path rotation calculation (prevents full 360¬∞ spins)

**Result:** Fine/precise/accurate navigation with cards locked in UI carousel layout properly.

## 🚨 Issues & Priorities

### ✅ All Critical Issues Resolved (Oct 9, 2025)

All major functionality is now working correctly with the normalized `violation_forms` + `violation_photos` schema.

---

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY (Enhancement/Optimization)

#### 1. **TypeScript Types Regeneration**
**Issue:** Outdated Supabase types causing `@ts-ignore` warnings  
**Impact:** Code quality, developer experience  
**Action Required:**
- Run: `npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id fvqojgifgevrwicyhmvj > src/integrations/supabase/types.ts`
- Remove `@ts-ignore` comments
- Verify no new errors

**Estimated Time:** 10 minutes

---

#### 2. **Historical Data Review**
**Issue:** Old data exists in `violation_forms_backup_before_migration` table  
**Impact:** Historical violations already migrated to current schema  
**Status:** ✅ Migration completed - data accessible in current `violation_forms` table

**Note:** No action needed unless additional historical data discovered

---

### 🟢 LOW PRIORITY (Future Enhancement)

#### 3. **Photo Storage Optimization**
**Issue:** Base64 photos in database (inefficient)  
**Impact:** Database size, performance  
**Action Required:**
- Upload photos to Supabase Storage
- Store URLs instead of base64
- Update all upload/display logic

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

---

#### 4. **Unit Number Validation**
**Issue:** `valid_units` table exists but not used  
**Impact:** No validation of unit numbers  
**Action Required:**
- Implement unit validation in forms
- Check against `valid_units` table
- Show error for invalid units

**Estimated Time:** 1 hour

---

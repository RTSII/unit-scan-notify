## 🗄️ Database Schema Review

### ✅ Current Tables (Supabase)

#### 1. **`violation_forms`** (Primary Table)
```sql
- id: bigint (PK, auto-increment)
- old_uuid_id: uuid (for migration tracking)
- user_id: uuid (FK → auth.users)
- unit_number: text
- occurred_at: timestamp with time zone
- location: text (violation type)
- description: text
- status: text (default: 'saved')
- created_at: timestamp
- updated_at: timestamp
```

#### 2. **`violation_photos`** (Normalized Photos)
```sql
- id: bigint (PK, auto-increment)
- violation_id: bigint (FK → violation_forms.id)
- uploaded_by: uuid (FK → auth.users)
- storage_path: text (path in Supabase Storage bucket)
- created_at: timestamp
```
**Note:** `storage_path` stores the storage bucket path (e.g., `{user_id}/{filename}.jpg`), not full URLs or base64 data. Public URLs are generated via `supabase.storage.getPublicUrl(path)`.

#### 3. **`profiles`** (User Profiles)
```sql
- user_id: uuid (PK, FK → auth.users)
- email: text
- full_name: text
- role: text (admin/user)
- created_at: timestamp
- updated_at: timestamp
```

#### 4. **`invites`** (Invitation System)
```sql
- id: uuid (PK)
- email: text
- token: text
- invited_by: uuid (FK → auth.users)
- created_at: timestamp
- expires_at: timestamp
- used_at: timestamp
```

#### 5. **`valid_units`** (Unit Validation)
```sql
- id: bigint (PK)
- unit_number: text
- building: text
- is_active: boolean
- created_at: timestamp
```

## 🏠💼 Multi-PC Workflow (Home ↔ Work)

Keep your Home and Work environments in sync:

### Home (before leaving)
- `git pull`
- `git add -A && git commit -m "<message>" && git push`

### Work (when arriving)
- `git pull`
- `npm ci` (use `npm install` only when deps change)
- Start dev: `npm run dev` (or your usual script)

### Consistency & hygiene
- Do not commit `node_modules/` (ensure it’s in `.gitignore`).
- Commit `package-lock.json` for deterministic installs.
- Align Node versions via `.nvmrc` and nvm-windows.
- Keep secrets in `.env` (never commit); securely share values for both PCs.

### Notes
- If installs drift, run `npm ci` to reset from the lockfile.
- Review `npm audit`; optionally run `npm audit fix`, test, and commit lockfile updates.

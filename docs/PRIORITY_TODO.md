# üéØ SPR Vice City - Priority Action Items

**Date:** October 7, 2025  
**Status:** Active Development

---

## üî¥ CRITICAL - Fix Immediately

### 1. **Admin.tsx - Switch to existing schema**

**Priority:** üî¥ CRITICAL  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED  
**Blocking:** Admin dashboards, delete workflow (cleared)

**Issue:**

- Still references non-existent `violation_forms_new`
- Stats, presence, delete calls fail or return empty data
- Needs to reuse the same query patterns as `DetailsLive.tsx` / `Books.tsx`

**Action Items:**

- [x] Update all `supabase.from('violation_forms_new')` calls to `violation_forms`
- [x] Adjust profile join keys (`profiles!violation_forms_user_id_fkey`)
- [x] Ensure fetch fallback + delete use new table
- [x] Validate cards (this week/month/all) after change
- [x] Smoke test admin on mobile

**Estimated Time:** 45-60 minutes  
**Assigned To:** Next development session

### 2. **Database Safeguards**

**Priority:** üî¥ CRITICAL  
**Status:** ‚úÖ MIGRATION STAGED  
**Blocking:** Data integrity, RLS enforcement (deploy migration)

**Issue:**

- `violation_photos` lacks a foreign key to `violation_forms`
- Need to confirm Row Level Security allows team-wide reads + uploader/admin writes

**Action Items:**

- [x] Add FK: `ALTER TABLE violation_photos ADD CONSTRAINT ... FOREIGN KEY (violation_id) REFERENCES violation_forms (id) ON DELETE CASCADE;`
- [x] Review/adjust RLS policies for both tables
- [x] Document SQL change / apply via migration script (**new migration:** `20251007164000_add_violation_photos_fk.sql`)
- [x] Re-test delete flows once FK exists (post-migration verification pending deploy)

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes  
**Assigned To:** Following Admin.tsx update

---

## üü° HIGH - Fix Soon

### 3. **TypeScript Types Regeneration**

**Priority:** üü° HIGH  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Blocking:** Code quality, developer experience (resolved)

**Issue:**

- Supabase types outdated (missing `violation_forms`, `violation_photos`)
- Multiple `@ts-ignore` comments throughout codebase
- Type safety compromised

**Required Action:**

```bash
npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id fvqojgifgevrwicyhmvj > src/integrations/supabase/types.ts
```

**Action Items:**

- [x] Run Supabase type generation command (`npx supabase gen types ...`)
- [x] Review generated types
- [x] Remove `@ts-ignore` comments from Books / DetailsPrevious / DetailsLive / Admin / Export
- [x] Fix any new type errors
- [x] Verify app still compiles and runs

**Estimated Time:** 15-20 minutes  
**Assigned To:** After Export.tsx fix

## üü¢ MEDIUM - Plan & Execute

### 3. **Old Data Migration (If Needed)**

**Priority:** üü¢ MEDIUM  
**Status:** ‚è∏Ô∏è ON HOLD  
**Blocking:** Access to historical violation data

**Issue:**

- Old violations stored in `violation_forms` table
- New app uses `violation_forms_new` table
- Historical data not visible in current app

**Decision Required:**

- ‚ùì Is historical data needed?
- ‚ùì How far back should migration go?
- ‚ùì Should old table be preserved?

**If Migration Needed:**

```sql
-- Map old data to new structure
INSERT INTO violation_forms_new (
  old_uuid_id,
  user_id,
  unit_number,
  occurred_at,
  location,
  description,
  status,
  created_at,
  updated_at
)
SELECT 
  id::uuid,
  user_id,
  unit_number,
  CASE 
    WHEN date IS NOT NULL AND time IS NOT NULL 
    THEN (date::timestamp + time::interval)
    ELSE date::timestamp
  END AT TIME ZONE 'UTC',
  location,
  description,
  status,
  created_at,
  updated_at
FROM violation_forms;

-- Migrate photos
INSERT INTO violation_photos (
  violation_id,
  uploaded_by,
  storage_path,
  created_at
)
SELECT 
  vfn.id,
  vf.user_id,
  unnest(vf.photos),
  vf.created_at
FROM violation_forms vf
JOIN violation_forms_new vfn ON vf.id::uuid = vfn.old_uuid_id
WHERE vf.photos IS NOT NULL;
```

**Action Items:**

- [ ] Decide if migration needed
- [ ] Test migration script on dev database
- [ ] Backup production database
- [ ] Run migration on production
- [ ] Verify old forms display correctly
- [ ] Update documentation

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours  
**Assigned To:** TBD (only if historical data required)

### 4. **Photo Storage Optimization**

**Priority:** üîµ LOW  
**Status:** üìã PLANNED  
**Blocking:** None (current solution works)

**Issue:**

- Photos stored as base64 in database
- Inefficient for large photos
- Increases database size
- Slower query performance

**Proposed Solution:**

1. Create Supabase Storage bucket for photos
2. Upload photos to bucket on form save
3. Store only URL/path in `violation_photos.storage_path`
4. Update display logic to fetch from storage
5. Implement image optimization (resize, compress)

**Benefits:**

- Reduced database size
- Faster queries
- Better performance
- Image CDN capabilities
- Easier backup/restore

**Action Items:**

- [ ] Create Supabase Storage bucket
- [ ] Update photo upload logic
- [ ] Update photo display logic
- [ ] Migrate existing base64 photos
- [ ] Test thoroughly
- [ ] Monitor performance improvements

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Assigned To:** Future sprint

### 5. **Unit Number Validation**

**Priority:** üîµ LOW  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Blocking:** Data quality (cleared)

**Accomplishments:**

- Added shared helpers (`normalizeUnit`, `isValidUnit`) in `src/utils/unitFormat.ts`
- Enforced letter-number-letter validation in `DetailsLive.tsx` and `DetailsPrevious.tsx`
- Normalized unit display/search across Books, Export, and Admin carousels
- Surfaced inline hints/toasts using the shared format description

**Follow-ups (optional):**

- [ ] Consider autocomplete backed by `valid_units`
- [ ] Evaluate adding API-side enforcement

**Estimated Time:** N/A  
**Assigned To:** Completed by engineering (Oct 8, 2025)

## üìù Notes

### Development Guidelines

1. **Always test on mobile** - Primary use case is iPhone field work
2. **Maintain normalized structure** - Use `violation_forms_new` and `violation_photos`
3. **Type safety** - Regenerate types after schema changes
4. **User experience** - Auto-uppercase, auto-populate, smooth workflows
5. **Error handling** - Graceful failures with user-friendly messages

### Database Best Practices

1. **Use joins** - Fetch related data in single query
2. **Map photos** - Convert `violation_photos[]` to `photos[]` array
3. **Format dates** - Convert `occurred_at` to MM/DD display
4. **RLS policies** - Ensure proper security
5. **Indexes** - Maintain for performance

## üìä **ROOF END ANALYTICS**

### **1. North vs South Access Distribution**
```sql
SELECT 
  roof_end,
  COUNT(*) as total_accesses,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (), 1) as percentage
FROM contractor_conversations
WHERE conversation_state = 'completed'
  AND roof_end IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY roof_end
ORDER BY total_accesses DESC;
```

**Output:**
```
roof_end | total_accesses | percentage
---------|----------------|------------
south    | 145            | 62.2%
north    | 88             | 37.8%
```

---

### **2. Access Patterns by Building + Roof End**
```sql
SELECT 
  b.building_name,
  b.building_code,
  c.roof_end,
  COUNT(*) as total_accesses,
  COUNT(DISTINCT c.phone_number) as unique_contractors,
  COUNT(DISTINCT c.company_name) as unique_companies
FROM contractor_conversations c
JOIN buildings b ON c.building_id = b.id
WHERE c.conversation_state = 'completed'
  AND c.roof_end IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY b.building_name, b.building_code, c.roof_end
ORDER BY b.building_code, c.roof_end;
```

**Output:**
```
building_name | building_code | roof_end | total_accesses | unique_contractors | unique_companies
--------------|---------------|----------|----------------|-------------------|------------------
Building A    | A             | north    | 22             | 8                 | 6
Building A    | A             | south    | 35             | 12                | 9
Building B    | B             | north    | 18             | 6                 | 5
Building B    | B             | south    | 41             | 15                | 11
...
```

### **3. Peak Access Hours by Roof End**
```sql
SELECT 
  roof_end,
  EXTRACT(HOUR FROM pin_delivered_at) as hour_of_day,
  COUNT(*) as access_count
FROM contractor_conversations
WHERE conversation_state = 'completed'
  AND pin_delivered_at IS NOT NULL
  AND roof_end IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY roof_end, EXTRACT(HOUR FROM pin_delivered_at)
ORDER BY roof_end, hour_of_day;
```

**Output:**
```
roof_end | hour_of_day | access_count
---------|-------------|-------------
north    | 8           | 12
north    | 9           | 18
